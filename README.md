Project Euler Solutions
=======================

This repository gather Gustavo Leite's solutions to the [Project Euler][1]
challange. Problem sets can be found [here][2].

> Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming
> problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve.
> Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods,
> the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most
> problems.

Explanations regarding individual problem's solutions can be found in comments
in their respective source code.
